<h2>This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories.</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

    <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
</p>

        <li><strong>Step One</strong><br />Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li><strong>Step Two</strong><br />Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</li>
