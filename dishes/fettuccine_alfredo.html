<h2>This rich and creamy fettuccine Alfredo recipe is easy enough for beginner cooks, but it's impressive enough for company. </h2>


<h3>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</h3>
