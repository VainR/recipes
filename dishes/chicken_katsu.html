<h2>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</h2>

<p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li> 
        <li><strong>Pank:</strong> Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
